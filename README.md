# Graveyard Cat Quest

For our proposed final project, we are making a 2-D action-adventure game. In this game, players control a pixel cat exploring a spooky graveyard environment while 
chasing birds and collecting artifacts. However, they must evade the relentless pursuit of a plague doctor who chases them throughout the levels. The game will feature
multiple levels with increasing difficulty and a story-driven progression leading to a final boss battle against an ancient being summoned by the cat. The requirements
will be fulfilled in the following way:

- Win/lose mechanic in every level due to Plague doctor and final boss
- Plague doctor has pathfinding AI + procedural generation of levels
- Game will include splash screen and multiple levels
